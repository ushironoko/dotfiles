13. ‚úÖ Backup and reinstall ~/.claude directory
14. ‚úÖ Refactor doctor.ts to remove class and use functional approach

### In Progress:
- None (all tasks completed)

### Pending:
- Code duplication refactoring (identified but not executed due to plan mode)

## 4. File Operations

### Created Files:
- **src/commands/doctor.ts** (684 lines)
  - Purpose: Environment diagnostics command
  - Key features: Checks environment, conflicts, ghq, config, MCP
  
- **tests/commands/doctor.test.ts** (168 lines)
  - Purpose: Tests for doctor command
  - Uses Bun test runner (not Vitest)

### Modified Files:
- **src/index.ts** (+4 lines)
  - Added doctor command import and routing
  
- **README.md** (+150 lines)
  - Added comprehensive troubleshooting section
  - Added doctor command documentation
  - Added common issues and solutions
  
- **shell/.bashrc** (modified then reverted)
  - Temporarily added mise shims PATH export
  - Reverted as unnecessary (mise activate handles it)

### Reviewed Files:
- **init.sh** - Understanding setup process
- **scripts/migrate-to-ghq.sh** - GHQ migration logic
- **dotfiles.config.ts** - Configuration structure
- **src/commands/install.ts** - Command patterns
- **src/commands/restore.ts** - Command patterns

## 5. Technical Context

### Architecture Decisions:
1. **Functional over Class-based**
   - Decision: Refactored doctor.ts from class to functions
   - Rationale: CLAUDE.md explicitly forbids classes
   - Pattern: Context object + pure functions
   
2. **Selective Symlink Handling**
   - Decision: Directory remains normal, only contents are symlinked
   - Rationale: More flexible for mixed content directories
   
3. **Bun Cache Directory**
   - Decision: ~/.bun/install/cache is acceptable
   - Rationale: Used by mise-managed bun for package caching
   - Only ~/.bun/bin indicates standalone installation

### Dependencies:
- No new dependencies added
- Existing: gunshi (CLI), c12 (config), consola (logging)

### Code Patterns:
- Factory pattern with context objects
- Command definition using gunshi's `define`
- Async/await for all file operations
- Type-safe configuration with TypeScript

## 6. Command History

### Key Commands Executed:
```bash
# Doctor command testing
dotfiles doctor
dotfiles doctor --verbose
dotfiles doctor --check=environment,ghq

# Installation fixes
rm -rf ~/.bun  # Removed after understanding cache is normal
dotfiles install --force

# Testing
bun test tests/commands/doctor.test.ts
bun run prepare  # lint + format + tsc + test
bun run lint
bun run tsc

# Investigation
ls -la ~/.bun/install/cache
which bun  # /home/ushironoko/.local/share/mise/installs/bun/1.2.21/bin/bun
echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | grep mise
```

## 7. User Context

### Communication Preferences:
- **Language**: Japanese (Êó•Êú¨Ë™û)
- **Style**: Direct, concise responses
- **Detail Level**: Minimal unless requested

### Project-Specific Instructions (from CLAUDE.md):
- **NEVER use classes** - use functions and objects
- **NEVER create .d.ts files**
- **ALWAYS** check lock files for package manager
- **ALWAYS** specify exact versions
- **ALWAYS** run quality checks before commit

### Discovered Preferences:
- User prefers investigating root causes before applying fixes
- Wants to understand why things work, not just make them work
- Values clean, functional code architecture

## 8. Issues & Resolutions

### Resolved Issues:

1. **~/.bun Directory Warning**
   - Issue: Doctor reported ~/.bun as conflict
   - Root Cause: Misunderstanding - ~/.bun/install/cache is normal for mise bun
   - Solution: Updated check to only warn on ~/.bun/bin existence

2. **PATH mise shims**
   - Issue: Doctor warned about missing mise shims in PATH
   - Root Cause: mise activate dynamically adds tool paths
   - Solution: Updated check to detect mise tool presence

3. **~/.claude Directory**
   - Issue: Doctor incorrectly warned about directory not being symlink
   - Root Cause: Selective type means directory is normal, contents are symlinks
   - Solution: Added special handling for selective type mappings

4. **Class-based Implementation**
   - Issue: doctor.ts used class (forbidden by CLAUDE.md)
   - Solution: Refactored to functional approach with context pattern

### Unresolved Issues:
- üü° Code duplication (61 pairs detected by similarity analysis)
- üîµ Refactoring plan created but not executed (plan mode)

## 9. Performance & Optimization

### Identified Opportunities:
- 79.94% similarity in factory patterns
- Repeated command argument definitions
- Duplicated error handling patterns
- Test setup code duplication

### Proposed Optimizations:
- Extract common types to src/types/common.ts
- Create unified factory utility
- Standardize command base structure
- Create test helper utilities

## 10. Security Considerations

- No secrets or credentials modified
- File permissions properly handled (755 for executables)
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- Backup system maintains data integrity

## 11. Learning & Discoveries

### Key Insights:
1. **mise bun behavior**: Creates ~/.bun/install/cache for package caching (normal)
2. **mise PATH management**: Dynamically adds tool paths via activate script
3. **Selective symlinks**: Directory structure preserved, only contents linked
4. **Bun test runner**: Different from Vitest, no vi.mock support
5. **Code duplication**: Significant refactoring opportunity identified

### Documentation Gaps:
- Need better explanation of selective vs directory symlink types
- Should document mise/bun cache behavior
- Testing strategy documentation needed

## 12. Next Session Roadmap

### Immediate Priorities (If continuing):
1. **Execute refactoring plan** (2-3 hours)
   - Create common type definitions
   - Extract factory patterns
   - Standardize command structure
   - Consolidate test utilities

### Short-term Goals:
- Reduce code duplication by 60%
- Improve test coverage
- Add auto-fix capability to doctor command
- Create integration tests for doctor command

### Long-term Considerations:
- Consider plugin architecture for commands
- Add configuration validation schema
- Implement rollback functionality
- Create web-based configuration UI

### Prerequisites & Blockers:
- User approval needed for refactoring plan
- Decision on auto-fix implementation approach
- Testing strategy for file operations

## 13. Session Artifacts

### Test Results:
```
‚úÖ All 96 tests passing
‚úÖ 192 expect() calls successful
‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
‚úÖ No lint warnings (after fixes)
```

### Doctor Command Output:
```
üìä Diagnostic Summary:
   ‚úÖ OK: 23 | ‚ö†Ô∏è  Warnings: 0 | ‚ùå Errors: 0

‚ú® All checks passed! Your environment is healthy.
```

## 14. Rollback Information
