# Save Session Context

Create or update HANDOVER.md for comprehensive session continuity.

## Instructions

1. Check if HANDOVER.md exists in the project root
2. If it exists and has `read: false`, update that entry to `read: true`
3. Create a new handover entry with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
created: [current timestamp in ISO 8601 format]
read: false
session_id: [generate unique session ID like session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS]
---
```
