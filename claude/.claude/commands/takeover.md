# Read Session Handover

This command invokes the `~/.claude/agents/takeover.md` sub-agent to read and display the saved session handover.

## What it does

The takeover sub-agent will:

1. Read the handover from Serena memory
2. Display it with proper formatting
3. Mark it as read with a timestamp
