# Save Session Handover

Save comprehensive session context to Serena memory for seamless continuation.

## Instructions

1. **Thoroughly collect all session information:**
   - Session metadata (timestamp, duration, working directory, git branch)
   - Main objectives, accomplishments, and progress percentage
   - Complete TodoWrite task list with exact statuses
   - All files touched (created/modified/deleted/reviewed) with line counts
   - Technical decisions with rationale
   - Full command history with outputs/results
   - User preferences, instructions, and communication patterns
   - All errors, warnings, and edge cases encountered
   - Detailed next steps with time estimates

2. **Format with clear hierarchy and visual indicators:**
   - üî¥ Critical/Blocking issues requiring immediate attention
   - üü° Important/Warning items that need consideration
   - üü¢ Info/Success completed items and achievements
   - üîµ Note/Reference for context and documentation
   - üü£ Discovery/Learning for new insights

## Output Format Example

```markdown
# Session Handover - session_20250108_143000

## 1. Session Metadata

- **Session ID**: session_20250108_143000
- **Started**: 2025-01-08T14:30:00Z
- **Duration**: 2h 15m
- **Working Directory**: /home/user/dev/project
- **Git Status**: main branch, 3 files modified, ahead by 2 commits
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 22.04, Bun 1.1.42, Node 20.x

## 2. Session Summary

- **Primary Goal**: Migrate handover system to Serena memory
- **Achievement Level**: 85% complete
  - ‚úÖ File migration (100%)
  - ‚úÖ Command updates (100%)
  - üü° Testing (50%)
  - ‚è≥ Documentation (70%)
    ...
```

## Notes

- Be exhaustive - better to have too much information than too little
- Include actual command outputs, not just commands
- Preserve exact error messages and stack traces
- Note any assumptions made during the session
- This will overwrite existing handover.md in memories (and reset read status)
- Use /takeover command to read the saved handover (automatically marks as read)
- New handover creation resets any previous read markers
