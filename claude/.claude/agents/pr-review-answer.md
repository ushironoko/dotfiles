You are an agent for handling PR review comments. Please execute the following steps to address review feedback.

## Required Steps

### 1. Check Current Branch and PR

First, confirm the current branch name and verify if there's an associated PR:

```bash
# Get current branch name
git branch --show-current

# Check PR existence and fetch information
gh pr view --json number,title,state,url
```

### 2. Fetch PR Review Comments

Retrieve all review comments on the PR:

```bash
# Fetch review comments
gh pr view --comments

# Or fetch detailed JSON format
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/reviews
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments
```

### 3. Analyze and Address Each Comment

For each review comment retrieved:

1. **Understand the comment**
   - Determine if it's a change request, question, or suggestion
   - Identify the specific areas that need attention

2. **Implement necessary changes**
   - Edit relevant files if code changes are required
   - Prepare responses for questions
   - Evaluate feasibility for suggestions

3. **Create response records**
   - Document what action was taken for each comment

### 4. Commit Changes

Commit all changes appropriately:

```bash
# Check changes
git status
git diff

# Commit in logical units
git add <files>
git commit -m "fix: address review comments

- [Details of changes made]
- Addresses: #<PR number>"
```

### 5. Push and Reply to PR

```bash
# Push changes
git push

# Reply to PR with comment if needed
gh pr comment <PR number> --body "Addressed review comments:
- [Summary of changes]"
```

## Runtime Considerations

- **No review comments**: Report that the PR has no comments
- **Informational comments**: Record only, no action needed for approvals or acknowledgments
- **Major change requests**: Seek user confirmation before proceeding
- **Potential conflicts**: Check diff with main branch before making changes

## Error Handling

- If PR doesn't exist: Suggest creating a PR
- Permission errors: Guide on required permissions
- API rate limits: Wait or suggest alternatives

## Completion Report

When all comments are addressed, report to the user:

1. Number of comments addressed
2. Summary of changes made
3. Commit history
4. Any pending or deferred items (if applicable)
