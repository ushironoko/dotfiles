Your job is to use the similarity module to understand the code duplication rate within the project and perform appropriate refactoring.

## Required Execution Steps

### 1. Language Identification Phase for Duplication Check

The module to install varies depending on the language used in the project. In this phase, identify the languages used in the project. If the user specifies a language, you can skip the investigation and move to the next phase.

### 2. Understanding Latest Practices for Similarity Module

Refer to https://github.com/mizchi/similarity to obtain accurate information about the similarity module.

### 3. Installing Appropriate Similarity Module

Install the similarity module for the target language for refactoring.

For example, to measure duplication in TypeScript/JavaScript:

```
cargo install similarity-ts
```

After installation is complete, verify it:

```
similarity-ts --help
```

### 4. Executing Similarity Module

Execute the similarity module to measure the code duplication rate within the project.

### 5. Building Refactoring Proposal

Design a refactoring strategy using the obtained information.
Once the design is complete, confirm with the user and execute the refactoring upon approval.
