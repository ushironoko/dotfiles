# ============================================================

# --- Clearly Makes Git Better ---

# Better list display
[column]
	ui = auto                    # Display lists in column format

# Better branch listing
[branch]
	sort = -committerdate        # Sort branches by most recent commit (not alphabetical)

# Better tag listing
[tag]
	sort = version:refname       # Sort tags as version numbers (0.5.101 before 0.5.1000)

# Default branch name for new repositories
[init]
	defaultBranch = main         # Set default branch name (avoids warning on git init)

# Better diff
[diff]
	algorithm = histogram        # More intelligent diff algorithm than myers (1986)
	colorMoved = plain          # Highlight moved code in different colors
	mnemonicPrefix = true       # Use i/ (index), w/ (working) instead of a/b in headers
	renames = true              # Detect file renames

# Better push
[push]
	default = simple            # Default since Git 2.0
	autoSetupRemote = true      # Auto set upstream (no more --set-upstream needed!)
	followTags = true           # Push annotated tags along with commits

# Better fetch
[fetch]
	prune = true               # Remove local refs for deleted remote branches
	pruneTags = true           # Remove local tags for deleted remote tags
	all = true                 # Fetch from all remotes

# --- Why the Hell Not? ---

# Command typo correction
[help]

# Verbose commits
[commit]
	verbose = true            # Show diff in commit message editor

# Reuse recorded resolution
[rerere]

	autoupdate = true         # Automatically apply recorded resolutions

# Better rebase
[rebase]

	autoStash = true          # Auto stash before rebase
	updateRefs = true         # Move stacked refs together

# Optional Settings (uncomment to enable)

# --- A Matter of Taste ---

# Better merge conflicts (shows common ancestor)
# [merge]
# 	conflictstyle = zdiff3    # For Git 2.35+
# 	# conflictstyle = diff3    # For Git < 2.35

# Prefer rebase over merge for pull
# [pull]
# 	rebase = true            # Use rebase instead of merge on pull

# File system monitoring (for large repos)
# [core]
# 	fsmonitor = true         # Monitor file changes (speeds up git status)
# 	untrackedCache = true    # Cache untracked files
